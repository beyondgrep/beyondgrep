    <h1>ack 3 is now in beta</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>ack 2.999_03</strong> has been released to beta.  It is feature complete,
        but we still will be working on speed improvements.  Compare
        ack's features to other grep-like programs in our handy
        <a href="/feature-comparison">feature comparison chart</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The beta is currently available via the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/PETDANCE/ack-2.999_03">Perl
        CPAN</a>.
        You can <a href="/ack-2.999_03-single-file">download a single Perl program</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3">contribute</a>
        or <a href="https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/issues">report issues</a> on <span class="github-logo">GitHub</span></a>.

    <h1>What's new in ack 3?</h1>

    <h2>New <tt>--proximate</tt> option groups matches near each other</h2>

    <p>
        A new option <tt>--proximate=N</tt> groups together lines of
        output that are within N lines of each other in the file.  This is
        useful when looking for matches that are related to each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, these results:
    </p>

<pre>
    15: First match
    18: Second match
    19: Third match
    37: Fourth match
</pre>

    <p>
        would look like this with <tt>--proximate=1</tt>.
    </p>

<pre>
    15: First match

    18: Second match
    19: Third match

    37: Fourth match
</pre>

    <h2>Improved and incompatible <tt>-w</tt> option</h2>

    <p>
        The <tt>-w</tt> option, which tells ack to only find whole-word
        matches, did not always work if your pattern began or ended with
        puncutation.  ack would make guesses as to what your intent was,
        but it was not well-defined.  Now, ack disallows regexes that
        begin or end with non-word characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means that if you use <tt>ack -w foo:</tt>, the new ack
        will not allow it, whereas ack 2.x would.
    </p>

    <h2>Added <tt>-S</tt> as a synonym for <tt>--smart-case</tt></h2>
    <p>
        For those without <tt>--smart-case</tt> always on, the <tt>-S</tt>
        will be easier for when you do want to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Smart-case matching makes ack do a case-insensitive search unless
        the pattern being matched has a capital letter in it.
    </p>

    <h2>Added <tt>-I</tt> to force case-sensitivity</h2>
    <p>
        If you use <tt>--smart-case</tt> in your .ackrc, you can use
        <tt>-I</tt> to force case-sensitivity instead of having to use
        <tt>--no-smart-case</tt> (which still works).
    </p>

    <h2>Significant speed improvements</h2>
    <p>
        Run times for ack 3 compared to ack 2.22 are 30-40% faster
        because of removal of unused infrastructure for plugins.
